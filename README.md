# GVPS Android App

An Android application designed to help Grand Valley students stay organized on campus with a Google Maps GPS integration.
Students have their own user accounts within the app.
The app includes a live Google Map in which they can view and save locations of interest to them.
These saved locations can be shared and used to facilitate Meet Ups for study groups, events, etc.
The app also includes a weekly schedule organizer, which is also connected to a specific saved location, so students are able to view their weekly schedule and also keep track of where their classes are on campus, and where they are in relation to other classes, events, meet ups, etc.
